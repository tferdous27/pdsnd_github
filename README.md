### Project title
Post Bikeshare Project on GitHub

### Description
In this repository, the bikeshare file from an earlier project is added. The purpose of the repository is to create some branches within GitHub, with commits on each branch. This is a required project in Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree at Udacity.

There are three branches: master, documentation, and refactoring in this repository. You can see that there are differences between the file in the master and refactor branches than the documentation branch.

The bikeshare project was created on 2021- 01- 18. Python was used to explore the U. S. bikeshare data. The project displayed bike sharing data for three major cities â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. An interactive environment was created where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

### Files used
- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### How to use the bikeshare interactive environment
- Run bikeshare.py file using Git Bash (for Windows)
- Answer a few questions to select your filter (i.e., city, month, day)
- The program will calculate the statistics and display system usage for your chosen filters, such as popular times of travel, popular station and trip, trip duration, user info, etc.
